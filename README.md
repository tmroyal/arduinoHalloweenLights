# arduinoHalloweenLights
A halloween light display using Arduino and NeoPixels. 

Demo is avaliable [here](https://youtu.be/xuuKolMKQ08).

The code alternates between a default setting and a randomly chosen preset that mimics lightning, a ghost, an evil eye, and a magic cauldron. When a random preset is selected, messages are sent out the serial port indicating the start and stop of the preset (except for lightning, for which only the start is indicated). This allows for coordination with other elements, like sound.

Happy Halloween!
